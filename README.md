# Project Description
Our project is a single-page web application built using React JS in TypeScript. 
The application will retrieve and store information from an existing backend API endpoint. 
As a stretch goal, we aim to make the web app a progressive app to enhance the user experience.

One of the key requirements for this project is to optimize load speed and performance. 
We will be using Google Lighthouse to evaluate performance and ensure the app meets high standards.
Additionally, we will be utilizing strong typing in TypeScript to catch errors before runtime and optimize the code.

The end goal of this project is to build a highly performant and user-friendly Progressive Web Application that provides a seamless experience for users.

## Main Sections
The application is divided into three main sections:

### Section 1 - Marker List & Properties
The first section lists the available markers, allowing users to select a marker to view its properties and update them if needed. 
This section provides a user-friendly interface for managing the markers.

### Section 2 - 3D View
The second section features a 3D view where users can see the markers in 3D space, pan, zoom, and click on a marker -represented as an orb - to view its latest readings and status. 
We will be using the Three.js library to implement this section and provide a visually rich and engaging experience.

### Section 3 - 2D Trace Chart
The third section displays the traces of the marker readings when a marker is selected, using a simple line chart. 
We will be using the D3.js library to implement this section, providing a clear and intuitive way for users to view the marker data.

# Project Requirements
- The web application must be a single-page web application built using React JS in TypeScript.
- The application must retrieve and store information from an existing backend API endpoint.
- The application must include three main sections: a marker list & properties section, a 3D view, and a 2D trace chart.
- The marker list section must allow users to select a marker to view its properties and update some of their properties if needed.
- The 3D view section must allow users to see the markers in 3D space, pan, zoom, and click on a marker to view its latest readings and status. This section must use the Three.js library.
- The 2D trace chart section must display the traces of the marker readings when a marker is selected, using a simple line chart. This section must use the D3.js library.
- The application must be optimized for load speed and performance, utilizing techniques such as code splitting, lazy loading, and caching to minimize unnecessary requests to the backend.
- The application's performance must be evaluated using Google Lighthouse to ensure it meets high standards.
- All modules and components of this web app needs to be unit tested.
- basic end-to-end testing is also needed.
- The end result of the project must be a highly performant and user-friendly web application that provides a seamless experience for managing and viewing marker data in both 2D and 3D spaces.

#Getting started
Explain how to set up the project locally, including any necessary dependencies and installation instructions. This section should be clear and concise to make it easy for someone to get started with your project.

#Usage
Give an overview of how your application works and how to use it. You can also include screenshots or a demo video to showcase your application.
